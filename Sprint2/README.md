## Sprint Ceremonies

- Daily Scrum: We had daily scrum meeting almost every weekday. On top of that we messaged daily in a group chat about the project.
- Sprint Review: In Sprint 2, we met most goals by creating a graphical interface with React and TailwindCSS. We created a working API that uses MongoDB to save the data. We had clear task managing system in Trello. Working together was smooth and tasks were completed on time.
- Retrospective:
- - Liked: We had well organized roles.
- - Learned: Using React and Tailwind in the front-end and Mongoose and Node.js in the back-end.
